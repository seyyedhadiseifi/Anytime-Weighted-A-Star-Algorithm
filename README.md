# Anytime-Weighted-A-Star-Algorithm
Python3 implementation of Anytime-Weighted-A-Star Algorithm

# Source Hansen, Eric A., and Rong Zhou. "Anytime heuristic search." Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 28 (2007): 267-297.

* set the value of w from line 13

* Anytime Weighted A* algorithm finds an upper bound and prune the open list. 

* Unline weighted A*, Anytime Weighted A* eventually converges to the optimum solution.

* Anytime Weighted A* allows a flexible tradeoff between search time and solution quality

# This Algorithms is implemented for two games, (1) find a path in maze, (2) 8-puzzle.

* 8-puzzle: check lines 180-184 for 8-puzzle board setting

* Maze: check lines 156-158 for maze board setting
